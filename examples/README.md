# Information Regarding MISST Examples

The **examples** included with MISST are intended to demonstrate possible use cases of MISST. Certain examples contain actual data, while others only include the barebone scripts. lLease refer to the following section for more details on which examples contain actual data.

As of MISST 0.1.2, there are 2 distinct examples:
1. `basic`: This example uses a minimal "toy" PSG dataset for training a MISST model. This example is only intended to demonstrate the barebone capabilities of MISST, not create a viable model. The dataset for this example **IS** contained within the example.
2. `johns_hopkins`: This example uses Johns Hopkins' Murine Dataset (provided by Lenise Kim & Dr. Luu Pham) for training a MISST model. The dataset for this example **IS NOT** contained within the example. 
    - This dataset will eventually be made publically available, at which point it will be accessible through the following link: [\[INSERT\]](about:blank).
    - In order to run this example, you will need to download the dataset from this link, and place it within the `./example/johns_hopkins/` directory.

These examples can be placed anywhere on your PC; they will always run properly as long as MISST is installed.
