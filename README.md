MISST employs deep neural networks to **automate the grading of murinae polysomnograms** (PSGs). This program was developed as part of a research project conducted at the *Johns Hopkins Center for Interdisciplinary Sleep Research and Education*. By using a combination of residual connections, Bottleneck blocks, and fully-connected layers, MISST is able to classify raw PSGs **with little to no preprocessing**, while still remaining **lightweight** and **consistent**.

Despite the abundance of existing sleep staging algorithms, few were specifically designed for murine sleep patterns. MISST reached a validation accuracy of 87.6% and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.74.

# Getting Started
Before installing MISST, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:
- Python 3.10 or later
- Git
- A system with 8 GB RAM or more
- At least 30 GB of free disk space
- Windows 10 or later (*MISST does not currently support Linux/Unix systems.*)

If you have a Windows system, run the following commands to install MISST:
```shell
C:\...> git clone https://github.com/Johns-Hopkins-CISRE/MISST.git
C:\...> cd ./MISST/
C:\...\MISST> pip install requirements.txt
```

# Preparing The Dataset
In order to use MISST, a specific dataset format must be followed. This section outlines the rules for both the PSG and Hypnogram files. The program may result in an error if this formatting is not strictly adhered to.

The dataset must be placed into the `~/MISST/mist/data/` directory, with the following structure:
- Each PSG recording **must** be in it's own subdirectory
  - The subdirectory can be named anything
  - The subdirectory can include unrelated files
- Both a Hypnogram (in .csv format) and a PSG (in .edf format) recording must be present within each subdirectory
- The Hypnogram and PSG can be named anything, as long as the RegEx is able to properly filter it out

The final MISST directory tree should look as follows:
```shell
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄMISST
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄdata
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄraw
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ[subdirectory_1]
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄEDF.edf
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄhypnogram.csv
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ[subdirectory_2]
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄEDF.edf
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄhypnogram.csv
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ[subdirectory_3]
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄEDF.edf
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄhypnogram.csv
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ...
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ[subdirectory_n]
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄEDF.edf
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄhypnogram.csv
```
Each Hypnogram ".csv" file should follow this format:
| type        | start                   | stop                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| SLEEP-S0    | 2021-10-19 10:12:44.000 | 2021-10-19 10:12:54.000 |
| SLEEP-S2    | 2021-10-19 10:12:54.000 | 2021-10-19 10:13:04.000 |
| SLEEP-REM   | 2021-10-19 10:13:04.000 | 2021-10-19 10:13:14.000 |

# Configuration
Before using MISST, the config.py file must be properly configured. To configure it, follow these steps:
1. Modify the `PATH` variable in the global_config.py file (located in `~/MISST/mist/global_config.py`) to the **exact** path of your MISST installation
2. Place your dataset within the directory `~/MISST/data/raw/`
    - Make sure your dataset follows the guidelines outlined in the [Preparing The Dataset](https://github.com/Johns-Hopkins-CISRE/MISST/tree/main#preparing-the-dataset) section
3. Since each subdirectory is allowed to have multiple EDF files, RegEx patterns are used to filter out all other undesired files. The first RegEx pattern is for the EDF file, and it can be modified in the config.py file by changing the value of `EDF_REGEX` to the desired RegEx. The second RegEx pattern is for the Hypnogram files, and can be modified by changing the value of `HYPNOGRAM_REGEX`. 
    - Both RegEx filters must filter out all but one EDF/Hypnogram

# Generating Annotations
To create annotations for your given dataset using MISST's **pretrained** model, just navigate to the directory in which you installed MISST, then enter the following command:
```shell
C:\...\MISST> python -m misst --mode generate
```
The annotations will be exported in the directory`~/MISST/data/annots/`. Each PSG recording will get it's own individual annots file, with the name of each annots file corresponding to the name of it's respective PSG recording's directory: `annots_[dir name].csv`.
This annots file will be formatted as follows:
| type      | start    | stop     |
| --------- | -------- | -------- |
| SLEEP-S0  | 10:12:44 | 10:12:54 |
| SLEEP-S2  | 10:12:54 | 10:13:04 |
| SLEEP-REM | 10:13:04 | 10:13:14 |

**Disclaimer**: MISST is still in development and has yet to pass rigorous testing. Johns Hopkins is not liable for any incorrect or misleading predictions outputted by the MISST model.
# Training
Follow these steps if you'd like to train a new model using MISST's ModelTrainer framework: 
1. Modify the `MODE` variable in the config.py file to the desired mode of operation. The following key can be used when deciding what mode of operation to use:

    | Mode Name | Description                                         | Current Status    |
    | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
    | PLAIN     | Basic model training mode                           | ‚úÖ Working        |
    | TUNER     | Uses a KerasTuner during training                   | ‚úÖ Working        |
    | GUI       | Provides a GUI for real-time training visualization | ‚ùå Not Working    |
    | DIST      | Trains using a distributed computing network        | ‚ùå Not Working    | 
2. Navigate to the directory in which you installed MISST, then enter the following line into the Command Prompt: 
    ```shell
    C:\...\MISST> python -m misst --mode train
    ```
